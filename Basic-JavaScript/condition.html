        // Tips about operation you must be careful when you use in if statement
        // I already had to understand something when
        'love' === 'answer' //it is false
        // but if 
        'love' === 'love' //it is true
        // because when people who you love doesn't love you back, it means the answer of your love is not true.
        // hahahaha it is just a joke

        // when you compare variable, you must make sure that the value is what you expect
        const expectedValue = 42;
        const userValue = 40 + 2; // this should be 42
        if (userValue === expectedValue) {
            console.log('The user value is as expected.');
        } else {
            console.log('The user value is NOT as expected.');
        } // Output: The user value is as expected.

        // and also be careful with type coercion in JavaScript
        const stringValue = '100';
        const numberValue = 100;
        if (stringValue == numberValue) {
            console.log('The values are equal with type coercion.');
        } else {
            console.log('The values are NOT equal even with type coercion.');
        } // Output: The values are equal with type coercion.

        // when you compare arrays or objects, be careful because they are reference types in JavaScript
        const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
        const array2 = [1, 2, 3];
        if (array1 === array2) {
            console.log('The arrays are equal.');
        } else {
            console.log('The arrays are NOT equal.');
        } // Output: The arrays are NOT equal. Because they reference different memory locations.

        '2' === 2 // it is false because of type difference because === checks both value and type
        '2' == 2 // it is true because of type coercion because == checks only value after type coercion
        // so be careful when you use == because it may lead to unexpected results due to type coercion
        // i recommend to use === as much as possible to avoid type coercion issues

        // false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, '' (empty string) are falsy values in JavaScript
        if (null) {
            console.log('true');
        } else {
            console.log('false');
        } // Output: false because null is falsy value in JavaScript

        !true // it is false
        !!true // it is true
        !false // it is true
        !null // it is true because null is falsy value
        !undefined // it is true because undefined is falsy value
        !0 // it is true because 0 is falsy value
        !42 // it is false because 42 is truthy value

        5 !== 5 // it is false because both value and type are the same
        5 !== '5' // it is true because type is different
        5 != '5' // it is false because after type coercion both value are the same
        // so be careful when you use != because it may lead to unexpected results due to type coercion
