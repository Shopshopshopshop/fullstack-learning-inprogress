# Full-Stack-Dev-Learning-Course-by-FutureSkill

Hi everyone! This is my first public repository. First of all, thank you for taking the time to check out my work. My goal with this repository is to practice both my coding skills and my English writing skills. I believe GitHub is a great platform for anyone looking to improve or switch career paths—just like me. This repository marks the beginning of my journey into software development, and I hope it will support both me and others who are working toward a future career in computational technology.

I hope you find something useful here, and feel free to share any feedback—whether through issues, pull requests, or any other contact method. Thank you!

## Introduction
This repository covers the basics of full-stack development based on what I’m learning from the Futureskill course. Everything here is explained in my own words, based on my understanding and practice. I am not copying, selling, or distributing any course materials.

My only goal is to summarize what I’ve learned and reinforce my knowledge while sharing it with others who may find it useful.

If you want to study the full course, you can check it out directly on the official Futureskill website.

I will be updating this repository frequently as I continue learning.
