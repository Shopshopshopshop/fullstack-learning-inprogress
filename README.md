# Full-Stack-Dev-Learning-Course-by-FutureSkill

Hi everyone! This is my first public repository. First of all, thank you for taking the time to check out my work. My goal with this repository is to practice both my coding skills and my English writing skills. I believe GitHub is a great platform for anyone looking to improve or switch career paths—just like me. This repository marks the beginning of my journey into software development, and I hope it will support both me and others who are working toward a future career in computational technology.

I hope you find something useful here, and feel free to share any feedback—whether through issues, pull requests, or any other contact method. Thank you!

## 📘Introduction
This repository covers the basics of full-stack development based on what I’m learning from the Futureskill course. Everything here is explained in my own words, based on my understanding and practice. I am not copying, selling, or distributing any course materials.

My only goal is to summarize what I’ve learned and reinforce my knowledge while sharing it with others who may find it useful.

If you want to study the full course, you can check it out directly on the official Futureskill website.

## 🔄 Updates & How to Learn

I will keep updating the files and adding explanations with comments in the code whenever I finish each topic.

I recommend using the **Google Chrome** browser and its **Developer Tools** (especially the **Sources** tab and debugging features) to run with my code step by step and really see how the programming language works.

**OR**

You can also:
- Read through this repository, and  
- Use documentation such as **MDN Web Docs** alongside it  

I hope this helps you improve your skills, and maybe this repository can guide you on what to learn next and how to better understand the concepts so you can move yourself forward. 🚀

## 🧱 Basic HTML

## 🧱 What I Learned Today: Basic Web Structure & First HTML Steps

This lesson introduced me to the basic structure of a website. I created my first simple HTML file, printed **"Hello, world!"**, and opened it in the browser.

### 📝 Creating Your First HTML File
To start, create a file with the **`.html`** extension so the browser knows it's an HTML document.

In VS Code, you can type `!` and press **Tab** to generate the default HTML template automatically.

Here’s an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
✨ Text Content: Headings, Paragraphs, and Formatting

I learned how to use headings (<h1> to <h6>), paragraphs (<p>), and basic text formatting such as:
	•	<strong> for bold
	•	<em> for italic

Example:
```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.</p>
```
🖼 Adding Images with <img>

I also learned how to insert images from the internet using the src attribute.
The alt attribute is important because it describes the image when it cannot load.

Example:
```html
<img src="https://example.com/hearin.png" alt="Hearin girl who look so cute!!!" width="300">
```


## ❓ FAQ

### **Why doesn’t this repository have much content yet?**

**Answer:**  
Because I’m still learning right now. Once I finish each topic, I will summarize it and update this repository.  

For now, you can still read my code to understand what the course teaches.  
I also leave comments inside the code to explain what I’ve learned — even if the format isn’t perfect yet.

When I complete the entire course, I will rewrite everything again in a cleaner and more professional format for everyone.

I sincerely apologize if the current content looks messy or incomplete.  
I am using this repository as a way to stay active, learn consistently, and document my journey.

I’m not a teacher, tutor, or professional programmer.  
I’m just a guy starting his journey in the computer science world — learning step by step.

I hope this repository inspires someone who is like me:  
someone who wants to start, learn, and move forward toward their dream career.  
Just do it. Don’t be afraid of anything.

Thank you for reading my little journal.  
I hope it makes you smile, feel motivated, or at least enjoy the progress I’m sharing here. 😊
